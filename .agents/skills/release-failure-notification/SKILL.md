# Release failure notification

Use this project policy when a release failure needs owner-facing incident context. It defines what a notification must contain and how delivery is selected; it does not silently choose a provider, secret, destination, or paging policy.

## Workflow

1. Copy `assets/templates/release-failure-notification-transport-gate.example.json` and explicitly select a project-approved transport.
2. Trigger only from a completed release workflow with a failed conclusion. Include repository identity, workflow run, head SHA, actor, and a link or durable reference that the maintainer can inspect.
3. Keep notification failure distinct from release failure, avoid leaking secrets or internal paths, and make retries idempotent.
4. Validate the selected transport and required credentials before enabling delivery. Without checked-in evidence or owner approval, stop at the selection gate.

## Adoption preview

Before applying this policy to a target project, preview the writes to `.agents/skills/release-failure-notification/` and `skills-lock.json`, then wait for explicit owner approval. Install it with `npx skills add IvanLi-CN/style-playbook-skills --skill release-failure-notification --yes`; the CLI detects the Agent and project layout.
